Desktop Theme Management

This project is a collection of scripts that manage Desktop Slideshow, Lock Screen, and Lock Screen Slideshow for Windows 10 workstations. currently, Microsoft does not supply a group policy that manages slideshow features. This project bridges this gap, allowing the system administrator to apply a "brand" to users' desktops
